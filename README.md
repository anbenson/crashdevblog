crashdevblog-example
==================

The example crashdevblog created for the Intro Web Applications workshop for ScottyLabs' CrashCourse 2014.

This website is created in Flask, backed by the worst database ever: RAM. It's notable, though, that it includes an AJAX request, I guess.

If you're in the Intro Web Applications workshop, this is not the right repository. This is the example website, not the working website.

The extra files (like the Procfile) are needed to get this to work on Heroku.

You can find this website hosted at crashdevblog.herokuapp.com. You could probably crash this easily, or do bad things, but please don't.
