crashdevblog
==================

A simple blog (somewhat similar to my [webdevblog](https://github.com/anbenson/webdevblog)) written in Python and Flask, but stores data in-memory (i.e. a Python list, and yes, I'm sorry, but it's easier logistically for teaching). Check it out at [crashdevblog.herokuapp.com](https://crashdevblog.herokuapp.com).

This was created for the Fall 2014 edition of [CrashCourse](http://crashcourse.scottylabs.org), a series of tech-related workshops at CMU hosted by [ScottyLabs](http://scottylabs.org). Students in the Intro Web Apps workshop wrote a blog very similar to this one. The starter code and the handouts for the event can be found in the 'resources' folder in the repository.

Steps to run:
- git clone git@github.com:anbenson/crashdevblog.git
- cd crashdevblog
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py
- go to localhost:5000

If you're trying to do this on AFS, take a look at the instructions in the PDF in the resources folder.
